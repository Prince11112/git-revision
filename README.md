# git revision

Work in progress...

```bash
> git revision
Welcome to git revision! This tool helps to generate useful version numbers and
revision codes for your project. Semantic versioning (i.e. "1.4.2") is nice but
only useful for end users. Wouldn't it be nice if each commit had a unique
revision which is meaningful and comparable?

    --baseBranch      The branch you work on most of the time
                      (defaults to "master")

-h, --help            Help!
-v, --[no-]version    Shows version information
    --format          [revision (default), more will come...]
    --test            TODO: remove
